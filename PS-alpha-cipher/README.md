#PS-alpha-cipher exercise

## Instructions
* Using vanilla JS, create a simple alpha-cipher encoder and decoder
* Provide notes on your code, including how to run it in the Candidate Notes section below.

## Rules
* The cipher should use a simple substitution cipher: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher
* You must provide both a way to encode and decode a string.
* The cipher should support single character, strings, and numbers as substitutions.

## Example
* Given the cipher key {a: 'b', b: 'c', d: e'...}
* Encode string 'abc' should return 'bcd'
* Decode string 'bcd' should return 'abc'
